Sometimes, my productive procrastination turns into a project! This is the new home for my fun side quests. I hope you enjoy!

## What's in this repo?
1. [show_picker.R](https://github.com/ashleymullan/side_quests/blob/main/show_picker.R) - Are you ever in the mood for a sitcom but can't pick an episode? This script contains a list of some of my favorite sitcoms and a function to pick a random episode.
2. [books.csv](https://github.com/ashleymullan/side_quests/blob/main/books.csv) - This dataset is a sample of books and time it's taken a person to read them. It's a great example of how outliers change data!

## Ashley, I want to use these anyway but don't have R installed locally!

I ðŸ’– R and strongly recommend you download it and play around with these scripts locally! If that's not for you, that's ok too. ðŸ˜Š

You can copy the code from any of my files with a .R extension and run them [here](https://rdrr.io/snippets/) in browser.
